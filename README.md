- 👋 Hi, I’m Markus Jahren Rohde, 23 years old.
- 👀 I’m interested in React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and with all that sitting down, I do enjoy a good run outside, maybe even a round of golf.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-End development, with focus on using React.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really, as long as I can learn something.
- 📫 How to reach me jahrenrohde@gmail.com is the best place.
